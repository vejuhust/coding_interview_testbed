Testbed for Coding Interview
=============================

This project was initially created to make myself prepared for coding interviews in Microsoft.

It was running on [Debian](http://beagleboard.org/project/Debian/) with [BeagleBone Black (Rev.C)](http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack).
